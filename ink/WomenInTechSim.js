There is a societal expectation for women to be perfect mothers and perfect workers. But it's hard balancing the bad ass boss lady persona with the parenting side of life. It's even harder when you feel so alone at work. With how little women there are in tech, it's unsuprising that some of them work in offices filled with tech-bros. Sexist comments are not uncommon.

There is no reason that people can't work from home on occasion, especially if they just had a baby or a huge life change.
