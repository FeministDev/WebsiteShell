But it's reality for some of the women who dedicate their lives to tech. They do what they are expected of, even a little more, but then they are denied promotions and raises due to the fact that their male co-workers are more respected and able to put in overtime. There is a societal expectation for women to be perfect mothers and perfect workers. But it's hard balancing the bad ass boss lady persona with the parenting side of life. It's even harder when you feel so alone at work. With how little women there are in tech, it's unsuprising that some of them work in offices filled with tech-bros. Sexist comments are not uncommon. These are the kinds of things that drive women away from STEM. It's an issue so deeply rooted that it sometimes feels like it's hard to win. But there are solutions!","\n","^We could make working in STEM more accessible. There is no reason that people can't work from home on occasion, especially if they just had a baby or a huge life change. Additionally, having on-site day cares would most likely raise productivity for parents. Also, there's no reason for offices to be bland -- concrete floors and white walls with limited decor can suck the life out of anyone. Tech is fun, and the work environment should be too! Put some bright orange murals on the wall, and cute striped rugs on the floors. Have an oil diffuser set up to give the room a good smell and great vibes. Play some LO-FI music in the background. Make the workplace cozy!","\n","^And above all else, make sure you are PAYING WOMEN WORKERS FAIRLY. Finding out you make less than your male co-worker for doing the exact same job could make anyone want to just give up. Don't be that boss.","\n","^Coming Soon-- a full on \"Women in STEM Simulation\" with many many choices. The story doesn't end here. You can help Jen find her perfect fit.
