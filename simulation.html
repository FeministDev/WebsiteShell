  <p> Sometimes STEM is a blissful environment for women to freely express themselves and innovate creative solutions to modern tech problems. Sometimes though, STEM can have hard to breach barriers. While we have come a long way from where we started, it's still true that only around 18% of Computer Science degree recipients are women. In addition to that, about half of these women will quit their full-time STEM career within 4 to 7 years of becoming a parent, as the work culture is just not family oriented.  This is why it is up to us to advocate for better work environments, flexible hours, and inclusion of women in all technology fields. To build a better world, we need all creative tech enthusists no matter what gender!</p>
